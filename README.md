# Hackathon FIESP - Debureaucratization & Digital Government

Our solution consists in a integration of the Digital ID System with new features. These features are meant to solve a problem of communication betwen the government and the society, as well as, reduce the costs of the government with publicity and give the opportunity for the citizen to be the lead of his/her public life.

The files in this repository are divided in 2 main parts:
- The AI that filters which information from the government should be sent to each of the digital citizens
- The front and back-end development of an app that made all of this visible for the user

I developed the AI for the project, and used a K-Means clustering algorithm to group the differents "types" of groups of people. I developed in Python and the app was developed by the other members of the group for iOS.
